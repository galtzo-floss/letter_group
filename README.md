No view code yet, for now just the logic.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'letter_group'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install letter_group

## Usage

See specs for usage examples.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.

## Maintenance

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Versioning

This library aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/).
Violations of this scheme should be reported as bugs. Specifically,
if a minor or patch version is released that breaks backward
compatibility, a new version should be immediately released that
restores compatibility. Breaking changes to the public API will
only be introduced with new major versions.

As a result of this policy, you can (and should) specify a
dependency on this gem using the [Pessimistic Version Constraint](http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/16#page74) with two digits of precision.

For example:

    spec.add_dependency 'letter_group', '~> 0.1'
